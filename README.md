# DSA Learning Assistant (CLI)

DSA Learning Assistant is a command-line based project designed to help learners understand **Data Structures and Algorithms** through **step-by-step execution and explanation**.

The project demonstrates how data structures and algorithms work internally by showing intermediate states, pointer/index changes, and operation flow directly in the terminal.

### Features
- Menu-driven CLI interface
- Step-by-step dry run of operations
- Clear explanation of each step
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Operation counting to explain time complexity growth

### Covered Topics
- Arrays, Stack, Circular Deque
- Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear, Binary)

### How to Run
```bash
g++ src/main.cpp -o app
./app
